1. Methods 'readInteger' and 'readDouble' are very similar to each other, but they are simple enough
    that making one, more complicated method have no sense for me.

2. Square test don't pass for one simple reason - with changing height or width we change every dimensions. 
    Of course it can be changed, but a square wont be a square anymore. In this case extending 
    Rectangle class have no biggest sense, because from this square we wont be able to make rectangle again. 
    This same situation applies to circle and ellipse. Both of these classes were tested by me and I left them deliberately in project.
